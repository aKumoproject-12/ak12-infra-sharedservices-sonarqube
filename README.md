# SonarQube POC â€“ Code Quality Testing

This repository is used to test and evaluate **SonarQube** as a code quality and security analysis tool.  
The goal is to run a **Proof of Concept (POC)** and see how SonarQube helps identify bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities in the project.

## Project Goals

- Test how SonarQube analyzes this codebase
- Understand the setup process (scanner, configuration, etc.)
- Review scan results for accuracy and value
- Evaluate how it fits into our development workflow (locally or in CI/CD)
